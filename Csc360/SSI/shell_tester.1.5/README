CSC360 Shell Tester: Written by Chris Matthews

To ensure that you can hand in the best shells possible, I have written a short python script to help you test them.

This script sends commands to your shell, then compares your output to an expected output. It removes whitespace, and your prompt. This is meant as a tool for YOU to test your shell.

The script is here. An example command file is here.

To use it:
%python shelltester.py -h

or make it executable, then run directly:
%chmod +x shelltester.py
%./shelltester.py -h

You can use the -h option to find out more, but a basic run might look like:
%python shelltester.py -f ./ssi -i ssi.in -r "SSI: .* >"

A successful run will look like this:

Test: remove insert ... . passed in 0.0081 sec.
Test: cd test ... . passed in 0.0082 sec.
All tests passed!


At the moment if your program segfaults, so will python.

Please feel free to modify the commands file to test your shell's output.

I have had some problems with not being able to distinguish whitespace from stdin vs stdout. If your test cases don't match correctly, but you think they should, try printing a line break after you read the users command.

There might be some bugs? Please let me know if you find any.
