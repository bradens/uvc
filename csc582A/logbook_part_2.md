As part of the work for preparing for this wednesday's class after the large break, we have to come up with a definition for a theoretical model.  I came up with this: 

```
A formally defined abstract method or object description that is generalized and can be used to solve or support multiple different problems.
```

I'm also going to be re-reading all the papers presented by the groups for the upcoming midterm.

Interesting discussion on what a theoretical model is, these are the keywords that stood out for me during the discussion: 

* formal definition
* rules
* abstraction
* probability
* axioms
* notation
* proof
* algorithms
* gamification
* visualization

I think that a theoretical model is a combination of these, suited to whatever the theoretical model needs to describe. 



I heard that google driverless cars use markov models for 'seeing' the world around them.  I wonder how that works(paper?).

I decided to research instructional videos on Markov Chains (as I didn't really know what they were), and I found a ton of online videos about it.

Sequential or temporal data

The markov model seems like a very good way to model anything with sequential or temporal dependencies.  It appears to be a good way to represent a state of something that changes with time.  

As well I looked up a graph clustering algorithm called Markov clustering which uses the same unlerlying markov chain model, and has uses in bioinformatics.

Jordan talked about K-means and varoni graph models.

The Groups decided on *markov chains*, *markov clustering*, *bayesian networks*, *procedural generation*.

Mathematical models vs Theoretical models

**Infection**

* Whats the difference?  Is there one?
  * Theoretical models are potentially less formal?
  * Mathematical modeling is always a trade off between
    * Simple models: highlight qualitattive behaviour
    * Detailed models; specific quantitative predictions
* Use the graph that she has about flow for modelling
* Sensitivity Analysis


**Networks**

* Are there any topologies that are more prevalent than others
