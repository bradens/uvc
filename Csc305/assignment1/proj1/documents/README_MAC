Integer Interpolation
    Description: 
        How to perform color interpolation in 2d space using only integers and addition.
    Solution: 
        Used and adopted Bresenhams line drawing algorithm, because it does not make use of any 
        division or mutliplication.
    Methodology:
        I looked for a version of bresenhams line drawing algorithm and adopted it to use color interpolation.
    Modified Code:
        lowlevel.c:132 - 440
        Makefile
    Additional remarks:
        Two interpolation methods.  In order to do Integer interpolation, it calls interpolate.  For floating point interpolation, change the calls to interpolate();
