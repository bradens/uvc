stems, fruit, or flowers. 
<LI> up to 7 pts. Use randomness (<i>man random</i> for more on generating
random numbers) in your drawing functions, 
to get more interesting and realistic

<li> up to 3 pts. Vary the colors and use color interpolation 
on your polygons to get a more natural effect. 
<li> up to 10 pts. Make a few different kinds of plants and group them
