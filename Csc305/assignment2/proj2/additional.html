<li> up to 12 pts. Change the rules of the L-system to get interesting plants.
Look at the real plants outside for ideas. Use buds, conditional

<LI> up to 10 pts. Use a few iterations of a 
<a href="recursivebez.html">Bezier curve</a> to get curved leaves,
stems, fruit, or flowers. 
<LI> up to 7 pts. Use randomness (<i>man random</i> for more on generating
random numbers) in your drawing functions, 
to get more interesting and realistic

<li> up to 3 pts. Vary the colors and use color interpolation 
on your polygons to get a more natural effect. 
<li> up to 10 pts. Make a few different kinds of plants and group them
together to make a landscape.
